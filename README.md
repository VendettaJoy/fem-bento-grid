### What I learned

This challenge allowed me to solely focus on bettering my understanding on the workings of the grid layout. The difference between using `justify-content`, `justify-items`, `align-content`, `align-items` tripped me up more than once because I am more used to using Flexbox, but I think I'm finally getting the hang of it! I've also taken to using `padding-block`, `padding-inline`, `margin-block`, and `margin-inline` as a better alternative to simply using `margin` or `padding` to adjust vertical and/or horizontal spacing. I also learned how to use `@font-face` for the project fonts rather than relying on link embeds.

### Continued development

I'd like to tackle more projects that require some fun grid layouts or even flexbox layouts :)
